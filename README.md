# Todo List Reducer

Simple Redux-style reducer for managing todo items in a state-driven application.

## useReducer Hook Example
This example demonstrates the useReducer hook by showing how it manages state updates through pure functions (reducers) that take the current state and an action as arguments. The reducer follows a predictable pattern: receiving actions to add todos and returning a new state array without mutating the original state.

## Features
- Add new todos
- Immutable state management
- Pure function implementation

## Installation
```bash
npm install
